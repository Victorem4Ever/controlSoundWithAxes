A little script that allows you to control the sound of some desktop apps with only axes like flight controls ...

There isn't any error recuperation and you need to change the datas like what controller is used and what axes are used.

Maybe I'll dev an user-friendly GUI but not today and not tomorrow because I don't care of you.
